Hi, welcome to my website! I'm a Ph.D. student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) [Tepper School of Business](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/). I'm in the [Algorithms, Combinatorics and Optimization (ACO)](https://aco.math.cmu.edu/) Program. I am very fortunate to work with Professors [Gérard Cornuéjols](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/gc0v/) and [R. Ravi](https://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~ravi/). I am broadly interested in combinatorial optimization, approximation algorithms, integer programming and nonconvex optimization.

I graduated from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2022 with a Bachelor in Economics, where Professor [Taotao He](https://taotaoohe.github.io/) guided me to the world of optimization. I visited Professor [Ahmad Abdi](https://ahmadabdi.com/) at [London School of Economics (LSE)](https://www.lse.ac.uk/mathematics) Math department in 2023 Fall. Besides, I'm grateful to the mentorship and guidence from Professors [Christopher Thomas Ryan](https://christopher-thomas-ryan.github.io/), [Tim Huh](https://www.sauder.ubc.ca/people/tim-huh) and [Fatma Kılınç-Karzan](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/fkilinc/) along the way.
